# Simple Shell


_A shell implementation coded in C to be ran on a UNIX terminal._

##### What you should know about the shell:

* `Piping` and `Redirecting` fully functional with usuage of `|` and `>` respectively. 

* `exit` to exit the shell.

* `ControlZ` ignored. 

* `ControlC` kills child process running inside the shell.

* `cd /path` to change directory.

* `pwd` presents working directory.

* `jobs` to display all jobs previously run in the background along with their PID.

* `fg pid` to bring the job with matching PID found in `jobs` to the foreground.

_Most other basic shell commands are functional._

_Just for fun I have set the command prompt to_ `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
